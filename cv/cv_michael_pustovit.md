# Michael Pustovit

**Most recent position:** Lead Mobile Engineer at INTELITY

## Brief overview

Hello! My name is Michael and I'm a software engineer. I started my professional programming career in 2012 (in the fifth year of Computer science faculty at Kyiv Polytechnic University) as a **Java developer**. But shortly after the start, I've switched to the **Android** world. I have been working on quite a few applications for the app stores and was involved in **full-cycle development**- from the initial estimation to the release/support phase. Most of the time I was working as an **Android developer** (Kotlin/Java), but also I have some experience with **Swift** (SDK creation and maintaining), **ReactNative**, **team processes facilitation** (played scrum master and team lead roles) and **extreme programming practices** (TDD, CI, pair programming).
